Keys pressed: ssh <up><enter>
  
I typed out `ssh`, and I saved time by pressing the up key once to access
my ieng6 address instead of typing the whole address out.
  
## Step 2: Clone the Fork

Keys pressed: git clone <command><v><enter>
  
I typed out `git clone`, and I pasted the link to the fork of the repository
by pressing command and v. (During the set up phase, I pressed the copied
button in GitHub to copy the fork's link.)
