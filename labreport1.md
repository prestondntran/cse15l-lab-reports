# Remote Access to CSE 15L!!

## Step 1: Installing VSCode

I have already installed VSCode in a previous class (CSE 8B), so I was able to skip to the next step. 
In case I need to install VSCode on a different device, I am providing this link to VSCode's website,
which will include instructions on installation: [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Upon opening VSCode, my page looked like this:

## Step 2: Remotely Connecting

Because I am a macOS user, I skipped the git installation step and went straight to the terminal in
VSCode, where I typed **ssh** followed by my CSE15L email address. When asked if I wanted to continue
connecting to the remote server, I entered *yes* and typed my password.

After entering my password, my terminal looked like this:

This means you have successfully logged in and connected to the CSE15L remote server!

## Step 3: Trying Some Commands

Once connected to CSE15L's remote server, I started running commands by changing the current directory
to *linux* using **cd**. Next, I typed **ls** to list the contents of *linux* and changed the current
directory again, this time to *cs15lwi23*. Finally, I typed **pwd** to print the absolute file path.

This picture of my terminal shows all of the commands I used:
